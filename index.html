        <h3 class="hobbies">Coding</h3>
        <p>We were taught HTML in school,In the school's computer practical lab,
          I was enjoying to code since the first day of our lab, and towards the end of the year my interest in coding grew drastically,
          It was then I decided in 9 th class that I would pursue Science and would do engineering as I was very interested in making softwares and gamesüòÄ.Later on in 11 th class we were being taught "Python".
          When I started loving the logic part of coding.So this is how coding became my hobby.</p><br>

        <p>In my 11 th class my friend told me about anime,I always argued with him by saying that anime is something which small children watch,
          but he kept on insisting me to watch anime;
          so I listened to him once and tried an anime which he was watching at that time,
          that anime was "Tokyo Ghoul". After completing it even before my friend,
          I started recommending him some anime.At the present moment I have watched even more anime than him.GET MY ANIME LIST <a class="MAL" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Vipdhruvkalra?status=2">HERE</a> </p><br>

<h3 class="hobbies">Playing Chess</h3>

        <p>When I was in 4 th or 5 th class, I learned to play chess from my grandpa,and played a couple of games.
          In my 10 th class in school we won inter-house chess competetion as the "Nehru house" in my school and secured the first position.
          On 14 th March 2021 we bagged the first position in the Inter college chess competition.Thus my love for chess is still there within me. </p><br>

        <h3 class="hobbies">Football</h3>

        <p>By the time I reached in 6th class I started to go and play football in my colony.It was a new sport for me at that time.Gradually as I kept on playing the sport I was becoming fond of it.
          I liked the role of the goal keeper very much as most of the time it depends on the goal keeper whether the goal will be scored by the opponent's team or not.
          So I usually liked being the goal keeper as I think that goal keeper play a crucial part in a game</p>
